## step 1. Vue Project and npm install

make brand new empty folder and open it as workspace in vsc

Make a Vue Project

npm create vue@latest and for now just press NO on everything. I'm calling my project vueapp (source)

 cd vueapp
  npm install
  npm run dev

CTRL - C to get out of it.

npm run build
